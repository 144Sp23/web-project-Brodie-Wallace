                <p>Welcome to the Northwest Intrafraternity Council. We serve as the governing body for all Greek Fraternities at Northwest Missouri State University. An Executive Board leads the council made up of leaders from those fraternities. The Board creates opportunities to build bridges between the organizations, the campus community, and Northwest Missouri State University's administration. The Board also is tasked with holding its member organizations accountable to the Interfraternity Council Constitution and Bylaws, Northwest Missouri State University Student Organization Conduct Policy, and Northwest Missouri State University Greek Life Standards of Excellence and values.</p>
